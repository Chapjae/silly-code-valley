# SillyCode Valley

## Useage

Sillycode Valley is a video app that generates improv prompts for users to inspire wacky scenes that they can act out and share with other users. Of course, improv can be intimidating so once a user completes their improv session with the app, they will have the *option* to upload their video, as opposed to being forced to. Assuming the user likes their video though they can freely upload their file up the gallery to share with other users. <br>

*users will see a landing page*<br>

Once a user presses the record button, the room will record their video and audio for 20 seconds. Upon completion, the user will be able to download their video with the download button, and then upload it using the Cloudinary widget.<br> 

*once a user completes their recording, they can review it before downloading and uploading*<br>

Users can review their recording and decide what they want to do with their video. If they want a private copy for themselves they may download a copy for themselves and if they like it enough, they will be free to upload it. <br>
